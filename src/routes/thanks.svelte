  <h1>Thank You</h1>
  <h2>A letter from lead developer u/Mautamu</h2>
  <blockquote>
    On behalf of the Game Mods and Game Devs, I would like to sincerely thank
    you for participating in season 3. Without you, this season never could have
    happened. <br />
    Additionally, this game is deeply indebted to the following individuals for their
    contributions to the game:
    <ul>

        especially for their dedication to calming the bot issues
      </li>
      <li>
        Mozilla Research, the Rust Foundation, Sergio Benitez, Jeb Rosen, Sage

          href="https://thanks.rust-lang.org/">Rust Language contributors</a

      <li>
        All those who submitted bug reports, game change ideas, or accessibility
        reports, or contributed in other ways to the advancement of the art
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Although this community has its flaws, I have met some truly fantastic
      people in it. In many ways, Season 3 is a direct result of u/32RH and
      u/AggieAlex's messages to try to get me to stop roguing (my personal
      objective in Season 2 had been a maroon Kansas which unfortunately
      conflicted with A&M's alliance with OU). Their messages caused me to join
      the Aggie Discord where I have met many people I consider friends. In
      order to maintain the game's integrity, I had left the Aggie Discord
      server for the duration of Season 3 and learned how much I appreciate the
      community that jyost17, avocado, igloo27, txag70, and others have
      cultivated. It is through this lens that we find how u/blinzz, u/32RH, the
      Aggie Discord mods, and u/AggieAlex have had outsized influence on 3.0
      coming to fruition. The same can be said of the Zoomer chat and the CFBR
      server; I have many fond memories of u/Belgara, u/BikkiBottom,
      u/Absurd-Fries-9296, u/InvertThatVeer, u/AProBenji and others in either
      pizza/food conversations or any one of thousands of other intriguing
      topics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, I would like to thank those who have raised legitimate
      concerns about the game in appropriate manners. Although I may disagree on
      the manner in which some things have been raised, some genuine points have
      been raised about the health of the game, the accessibility of the UI, the
      influence of bots, and other topics. I hope that the changes made to the
      game and/or to the community have not gone unnoticed. I believe that some
      more sweeping changes will be warranted for Season 4, and hope that
      everyone can join in a collaborative and supportive environment for
      bringing about these changes to make Season 4 the best season of CFBR yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the CFBR-oriented chats begin to go dormant for the next few months, I
      will be taking a much-needed break to recalibrate. In the CFBR offseason,
      we are looking for leaders for Season 4 both from a development but also
      from a moderation perspective; my hope for Season 4 is that we can have
      many people involved in the operations of running the game, especially
      from previously underrepresented teams. It's an open secret that in 3.0 we
      focused on transparency of game development and did not take many risks or
      make many substantial change in order to entice folks to participate once
      more and build trust; in exchange, we hope many contributors come forward
      to empower more fundamental changes to the game in Season 4.
    </p>

    <p>
      If I left you out of this, I apologize! There are <i>so many</i> individuals
      who I want to thank for their contributions to the community or the game but
      I also want to keep this readable. Know that your contributions have not gone
      unnoticed and are much appreciated.
    </p>
    <br />
    Sincerely, <br /> u/Mautamu
    <br /><br />

      >Long live the legion!

  <h2>Comments Regarding Season 4</h2>
  <p>
    Naturally, many questions will come up over the course of the next few
    months regarding Season 4. The details of Season 4 have not yet been
    determined, and the post-season survey will be a large input into the season
    4 determination. The best way to see the changes made to the game that you
    want is to get involved. Anyone with experience or willingness to learn in
    UI (HTML/JavaScript/CSS) or Backend (SQL/Rust/Python) is welcome to submit
    PRs for changes you want to see in a potential Season 4. Regardless of
    programming experience or desire, all are welcome to participate in the
    public beta games and contribute to the public forums which will likely
    begin in early May.
