  <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Don't be a Jerk:</b> This is our catch-all, our most important rule. Whatever
        you have to say, you can say in a way that shows respect to the other people
        in this server. If someone wants to be left alone, leave them alone, even
        if you think you're right. If you can't keep yourself from being abrasive,
        you shouldn't participate.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Contribute Positively:</b> We're here to have fun; general chat, generally,
        is for anything and everything. However, keep conversation in other channels
        relevant to their channel topics, especially more serious channels (like
        those for game discussion).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>No Politics:</b> Political discussions almost never make an online community
        healthier, and we're not going to tempt fate.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>No Bigotry:</b>
        Hateful comments on the basis of race, religion, nationality, gender, age,
        disability, sexual orientation or other similar characteristics will not
        be tolerated.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>No Soliciting, Advertising, Or Spamming:</b>
        This is not a commercial forum. Spamming is the practice of sending repeated
        unsolicited, unwanted messages, often of low quality.
        <br />
        If you are a spam bot, you will be summarily executed in the square.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Respect Others' Privacy:</b>
        Do not post personal information about other people without their consent.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Show Restraint:</b>
        If someone violates the rules, do not try to police them yourself; contact
        the administrators and let us handle any discipline. While we appreciate
        your vigilance, the administrators have procedures to ensure that each violation
        is investigated promptly and resolved appropriately.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>No baiting:</b>
        If you try to provoke somebody to break these rules to bring discipline upon
        them, you may be subject to discipline as well.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>
  <h1>Test Game Policy</h1>
  <p>
    Test games are, by their nature, dynamic; therefore, by playing during a
    test game, you consent to mid-game changes to the UI, the API, gameplay/game
    rules, and other similar elements pertinent to the game, with or without
    advanced notice. Furthermore, you agree not to make unfounded and/or
    overblown complaints about test game changes.
