# Gia: An Experimental UI for College Football Risk
*Monkeyin' around*

---

Gia is an experimental front end for [College Football Risk](https://collegefootballrisk.com/) that will be a transformation of the old Rust Risk front end (codenamed [AR](https://github.com/CollegeFootballRisk/Risk/tree/stable/static)). The north stars for Gia are as follows:

* **A better mobile experience.** The old AR front end was not easy to use on mobile. By switching to a map-centric design, providing better hints and capabilities, and incorporating user feedback holistically, Gia seeks to improve the mobile experience to make CFBR a welcoming platform for both Desktop and Mobile users.
* **Improved accessibility.** Because the College Football community we serve has a great many diverse interests and people, we want to keep the website simple while also striving to make it accessible and welcoming to all. Gia will accomplish this by adding accessibility features absent in AR, by decreasing UI and API complexity, and by providing more detailed context clues to assist users in having an excellent user experience.
* **Greater, more uniform, performance.** The old AR front end lacked crisp performance and did not follow any consistent overarching design choices or themes. To avoid this mistake, Gia will work on customizability, design patterns, and follow the [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) methodology.
* **A map-centric interface.** The data that RR conveys, and that is important to CollegeFootballRisk as a whole, is centered around the map. Shouldn't the UI be, too? To accomplish this north star, Gia will prominently display the map interface and work to improve pan/zoom performance, map interfacing, and map hints.

Gia is built to complement the [Rust Risk](https://github.com/CollegeFootballRisk/Risk) backend, and is meant to be a drop-in replacement for AR. 

Gia is inspired by:
